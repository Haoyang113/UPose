# <img src="UPose Logo.png" alt="Your Scene Name" width="150"/> UPose - AI motion tracking for Unity

UPose is a Unity resource that utilizes different AI methods for human motion tracking and demonstrates its capabilities in a gallery of sample applications.
You can use the UPose framework as a setup for your own projects, as an experimental setup for human-computer interaction research, or even as instructional material for courses that involve movement, media, and machines. 
### Features
- 🦾 MediaPipe human motion tracking
- 🦿 MMPose human motion tracking
- 📐 Compute joint rotations from mediapipe or other skeletal data
- 💻 Simple API for accessing human pose data
- 🧍 Standard Human IK skeleton support
- ⌨️ Real-time data streaming from Python to Unity
- 🏃 Several interactive demos included

For more info on how UPose calculates joint angles from media pipe world coordinates [read our tutorial](UPose.md).

## 💻 Unity C# Example
UPose API is simple and easy to use in C# in Unity. Here is a 3-line example that shows how to get a bone rotation from the motion tracker and apply it to an avatar.

```csharp
MotionTrackingPose pose = FindFirstObjectByType<UPose>();

//Get right fore arm rotation
Quaternion rotation=pose.GetRotation(Landmark.LEFT_ELBOW);

//Apply the rotation to your avatar
LeftForeArm.localRotation=rotation;
```

## 💀 Skeletal Structure
UPose supports avatars with the standard human IK skeleton. Avatars with this structure can be created using tools such as readyplayer.me.
The UPose API gets the 3D coordinates of the corresponding human joints from the motion tracking source (MediaPipe, MMPose, etc.) and it calculates joint rotations that can be then assigned as localRotations to the corresponding bones of the skeleton. The bone hierarchy and naming convention is shown below:

```
- Hips
  - Spine
    - Spine1
      - Spine2
        - Neck
          - Head
            - HeadTop_End
            - LeftEye
            - RightEye
        - LeftShoulder
          - LeftArm
            - LeftForeArm
              - LeftHand
        - RightShoulder
          - RightArm
            - RightForeArm
              - RightHand
```

## ▶️ How to run

The motion tracking methods are implemented in Python and stream the data to Unity. 
To install Python and the motion tracking libraries please refer to the installation guide below.
Once you complete the installation, you can run UPose with the following steps:

### Step 1 - Start the Motion Tracking Steam
To run mediapipe go into the folder `GitHub/UPose/MotionCapture/mediapipe` and run:
```
conda activate mediapipe
python run_mediapipe.py
```
This program will attempt to connect to Unity and stream the motion capture data to your Unity project. You can close the python project by pressing the escape button on the camera window.

### Step 2 - Run a Unity Demo Scene
Open in Unity the project `GitHub/UPose/UPose` and select one of the sample scenes provided in the UPose framework. The sample scenes can be found in the Unity project folder `Assets/Scenes`.

Keep the python program running while using UPose in Unity to see the motion capture data in action!

Enjoy! 🧍🏃‍♂️🕺

## ⚙️ Installation

### MediaPipe
The mediapipe tracking works in Python. It is recomended that you install miniconda, a minimal version of Anaconda, in order to keep the python setup of this project separate from other python installations in your computer. https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

After installation you need to use the terminal and run from the folder `miniconda3/bin` or `miniconda3/Library/bin` the following:
```
conda init
```

You can verify your miniconda installation by:
```
conda --version
```

Then you can create a new environment for the mediapipe setup:
```
conda create -n mediapipe python=3.9
conda activate mediapipe
```

Then you can install the dependencies of this project:
```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe upose
conda deactivate
```

### MMPose
```
conda create --name openmmlab python=3.8 -y
conda activate openmmlab
```
